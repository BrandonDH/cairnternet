# cairnternet
Imagine you are hiking in the mountains. The sun is going down, and the trail is old and hard to follow. Just when you lose sight of your path you see a stack of blocks, stones, and pebbles marking the way. That pile of rocks is a Cairn and it is handmade, by hikers who came before you.  Cairn /kern/ Noun - A mound of rough stones built as a memorial or landmark, typically on a hilltop or skyline.  I’d like to build a Javascript app that lets a user add a stone to a Cairn using drag and drop functionality with drawings of rocks like ones below. Anyone who visits the site will be able to add 1 stone. Each stone will be randomly generated by a loop that draws from an array of images of stones like the one here. I will use a math library to get a random size for each stone.  I’d also like to use plain Javascript for this project.
